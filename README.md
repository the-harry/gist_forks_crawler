# Gist Forks Crawler

Have you ever wanted to compare a diff of some gist between forks?
This code get an github fork url and crawl all forks with changes compared to the original repo.

The total diff between forks will be saved in a txt file.

You may want to add or remove new filters for other repos, since we never know what internet will give to us.

This project was created to crawl over [this gist](https://gist.github.com/tbrianjones/5992856), but it may be usefull for other repos.
